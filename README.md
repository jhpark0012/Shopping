# Shopping 
[First Toy Project] Shortest Shopping Path Web

## Period
22.01.01 ~ 22.01.27

## Background
When we go grocery shopping, we go to the mart after writing down the attractions in advance. However, most of the time, we write down what comes to my mind, not by product category.

So, when we arrive at the mart, we keep checking the memo paper from beginning to end, or we come back from where we came from and choose a product.

To solve this problem, I would like to create a web that informs the shortest distance of movement using the BFS algorithm and streamlit that I recently learned.


## Data
- **web_img**
  *structure.png*
  
  a graphic representation of the structure of a supermarket
  
  *s_1_to_5.png, s_6_to_10.png*

  data representing 10 sections

- **datasets**
  *dataset_kor.csv, dataset_kor.pkl*

  data tabulated with structure.png, s_1_to_5.png, and s_6_to_10.png

- **emoticon**

  web emotion data 


## Expected Outcomes
It is possible to quickly go grocery shopping through efficient movement, thereby reducing unnecessary waste of time,

Since it does not stay at the mart for a long time, it is expected that it will be able to make economic consumption habits as it does not allow people to purchase unnecessary products other than existing small products.
